            <h2>Hi, I am Mariia Popova</h2>
            <p>
                I hold a 
                specialist degree in light industry engineering and am currently studying manual QA at Hillel IT School. 
                I work at a large mining and processing plant as an operator and dispatcher, handling repair requests for mining equipment, 
                coordinating between departments, and working with subcontractors. I use specialized software to monitor equipment conditions. 
                Iâ€™m transitioning to IT because I no longer see myself in my current role, having experienced burnout. Over the years, I developed 
                strong communication skills, managing numerous requests from mechanics, engineers, and supervisors, often under time pressure."
